Oragono is a modern, experimental IRC server written in Go. It's designed to be simple to setup
and use, and to provide the majority of features that IRC users expect today.

It includes features such as UTF-8 nicks and channel names, client accounts and SASL, and other
assorted IRCv3 support.

                                     https://oragono.io/

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


=== Installing ===

Copy the example config file to ircd.yaml with a command like:

    $ cp oragono.yaml ircd.yaml

Modify the config file as you like. In particular, the `connection-throttling` and
`connection-limits` sections are working looking over and tuning for your network's needs.

To generate passwords for opers and connect passwords, you can use this command:

    $ oragono genpasswd

Run these commands in order -- these will setup each section of the server:

    $ oragono mkcerts
    $ oragono run

And you should now be running Oragono!


=== Updating ===

If you're updating from a previous version of Oragono, checkout the CHANGELOG for a shortlist
of important changes you'll want to take a look at. The change log details config changes,
fixes, new features and anything else you'll want to be aware of!

If there's been a database update, you can run this command to upgrade it manually:

    $ oragono upgradedb

Otherwise, just starting the server will run an automagic backup and upgrade.
